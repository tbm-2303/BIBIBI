# Human development - snapshot of the world with newest available data.

## Problem context:
Human development is one of the primary interest of many international orginasations and/or a major part of their expressed goals. 
Examples of orginations with such expressed goals: 	
1. UN
2. OECD
3. WHO
4. IMF
5. World Bank
6. WTO
7. DAC
8. UNDP
9. UNICEF

Efforts have been made in terms of international aid, economic trade deals, infrastructure stimulation and so on. Some developing countries have made extreme improvement over the last 20 years while others are still strugling in critical areas of human development. 
Some unique indexes have been constructed to track the this development in selected areas, but theese constructed metrics naturally cant cover all aspect of human development.  

## Purpose:
This project aims to identify countries with extreme challenges in critical areas of human development. Variables within these broader categories have been selected to shed light on the gobal human development:
1. Extreme poverty and income
2. Education
3. General health and healthcare
4. Access to basic necessities
5. Population trends

## Research question:
Can we use clustering algoritmes to group countries based on relevant socio-economic factors, health factors and other important metrics, in order to identify countries with extreme challenges in human development.


## Hypothesis:
Focussing effort both in terms of prioritizing countries and in terms of specific strategies would be a valuable tool for international organisations.
There are also alot of humanitarian organisations and ngo's that would/could benifit from a focussed strategy.
